<p>This book explores flow (the mental state associated with high performance and
distorted sense of time, among other things). It does so primarily by
chronicling the training and great feats of several action and adventure
(extreme) sports athletes. It also provides a brief background on flow research.
In the introductory pages, the author claims that though the book is about the
athletes, the larger goal of the narrative is to uncover how flow works so we
can apply it to ourselves.</p>
<p>How well does the author, Steven Kotler, do all this? A brief history of flow
research is provided, as well as an overview of our current understanding of
"flow triggers" and the brain activity (chemical and electrical) that shows up
in the state of flow. Again, it's not an incredibly deep survey of the research,
but is a good introduction for those unfamiliar (like I was). From my memory,
here are a few of the concepts: 
* Characteristics of the flow state
  * Flow is autotelic, pleasurable and rewarding in and of itself
  * Loss of sense of time. Sometimes a slowing of time.
  * In extreme cases, loss of sense of self (i.e. the boundaries between self
      and "everything else").
  * Each action flows naturally from one to the next.
  * Focus is purely on here and now; the rest of the world slides away from conscious perception.
  * Measures of mental and physical performance skyrocket.
  * Creative solutions seem to appear out of nowhere into consiousness.
  * Transient hypofrontality - A decrease in activity of the brain's
      prefrontal cortex. Presumed to be why one's "inner critic" is switched
      off (or at least reduced) in the state.
* External triggers of flow:
  * Rich environment - lots of stimulus
  * Clear goals
  * Fast feedback - Your environment gives you fast/immediate feedback to your
      every action.
  * Risk and danger - Physical risk sharpens focus. But creative and social
      risks can have similar effects.
* Internal triggers of flow:
  * Challenge/skills balance - If the task at hand is too difficult, one
      experiences stress and doesn't enter flow. Too easy, and the brain isn't
      engaged with the activity; boredom is the result.
* Accumulative impact of repeated flow "sessions". Repeatedly entering the flow
    state, repeatedly pushing one's boundaries that little bit further is what
    brought the athletes to their most groundbreaking accomplishments.</p>
<p>The majority of the book though is about action and adventure athletes (think
surfers, skiiers, kayakers, mountaineers, climbers, etc.).  Kotler, turns out,
was an action and aventure sports journalist for a time and it shows. Lots of
daring feats are recounted. It seemed every such tale was about "the most
daring, impossible, ridiculous <em>X</em> ever seen in the history of the sport of
<em>Y</em>". Perhaps such diction provides an accurate portrayal of these
accomplishements (I must trust the author on this, as I know very little of
extreme sports). Nevertheless, what is "impossible" changes every 10 pages,
which is to say that the narrative jumps from sport to sport quite a lot.</p>
<p>In my view, the whole "pushing the impossible" thread doesn't speak as well to
the power of flow than other aspects of these tales. Kotler says that flow is
the reason for speed with which action sports have advanced. Fast compared to
what? It just doesn't seem a useful statement to me, but it doesn't <em>sound</em> good
(as in headline-worthy). But there are aspects of these stories that are
fascinating. One of the big-wave surfers saved himself in a giant wave (~60ft
tall if I remember correctly) by pulling a move that he never practiced and had
never been used before by other surfers. See "creative solutions appearing out
of nowhere" above. The Red Bull Air Force learned how to interpret and predict a
teammate's intentions based solely on subtle movements of their feet. Not
something you'd think ordinarily possible (see "skyrocketing mental performance"
above). This helped them coordinate the group wingsuit BASE jump flight off of
Sears Tower in Chicago.</p>
<p>So what I'm saying is: yes, these events are spectacular; yes, they redefined
what most people thought possible in the sport; but re-stating that over and
over again isn't helping me understand flow much better.</p>
<p>This brings me to the last aspect of the book: applying what we know about flow
to cultivate more of it in our lives. Of the three main "threads" of this book
(flow research, extreme athletes, and practical advice), this had the fewest
words spent on it. Knowing the characteristics of flow can help us understand
<em>why</em> it has the effects it does. Knowing about the triggers (environmental and
internal factors seen to cause the state) can give us ideas on how to structure
our lives and training to invite the state. Seeing how extreme atheletes train
can also give us ideas, but it's not usually clear how to apply them to more
"normal" endeavors. Occassionally Kotler will interject the narrative with some
commentary that aims to fill this gap. They mostly feel like brief asides and I
would have appreciated more discussion of these ideas. That being said, there
were some useful bits. Here are a couple examples:
* One professor interviewed for the book drives a different route to and from
    work everyday. This is (supposedly) a way to increase the novelty in his
    environment (which is a trigger of flow).
* Though most of our daily lives don't offer ample opporutnity to risk life and
    limb, taking social and emotional risks can be a powerful flow trigger.</p>
<p>Lastly, I'll mention one last topic treated toward the end of the book: group
flow. The main point was that flow can occur simulataneously in a group of
people, with potentially <em>greater</em> effects than individuals experiecing flow
alone.  Here are a few ideas that stood out (really, these are just loosely
related ideas that I found interesting):
* Flow often happens in work conversations for a few reasons:
  * Shared goals
  * Shared background and knowledge, which eases communication
* Ways to encourage group flow:
  * Shared goals
  * A shared "language" or background that the whole group can understand.
  * Blending egos. People shouldn't be hogging the spotlight.
  * "Always say yes" - "Yes and" instead of "yes but".
  * Listen fully. You shouldn't be consciously thinking about what to say next
    while listening to someone else speak.
  * Foster autonomy and competence.</p>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>I like writing and tend to have an opinion on writing style. So I'll probably
say a few words regarding style in my book reviews.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the narrative tends to jump around quite often, requiring
context switches that were jarring at times.</p>
<p>Aside from this, the writing is approachable. Reads more like a long news
article than an essay. Lots of hypophoras. I just didn't love the writing style
for some reason, though. It wasn't <em>bad</em>. Just wasn't particularly attractive to
me.</p>
<h2>Annotations and highlights</h2>
<p>I read this book on my Kindle and occasionally highlighted interesting passages,
sometimes adding brief notes. Here they are:</p>
<h2>Things from this book I applied to my own life</h2>
<p>If you're not throwing yourself off skyscrapers for "sport", there's no quick,
easy way into flow. But this book gave me a few ideas I was able to apply to
my life and work to positive effect.</p>
<ol>
<li>Decomposing work tasks into small chunks and setting time-based goals (e.g.
   complete XYZ in the next 1 hour). This was largely inspired by this excerpt:<blockquote>
<p>"Applying this idea in our daily life means breaking tasks into bite-size
chunks and setting goals accordingly. A writer, for example, is better off
trying to pen three great paragraphs at a time—the equivalent of moving
through Mandy-Rae’s kick cycles—rather than attempting one great chapter.
Think challenging, yet manageable —just enough stimulation to shortcut
attention into the now, not enough stress to pull you back out again."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I used this strategy to break down my programming tasks at work and found it
   particularly effective. Trying to tackle to large of a task/feature all at
   once makes my brain hurt, and I can spend lots of time thinking about it
   without getting much done. If I instead ask "what's the smallest step I can
   make right now toward this larger goal" and focus on that smaller task (with
   a clearly defined expected result), then it's much easier to make progress
   and stay engaged. Staying focused is easy. I was able to maintain a very
   productive rhythm for about 1 week with this approach. </p>
<ol>
<li>Tightening feedback loops:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tighten feedback loops. Put mechanisms in place so attention doesn’t have to
wander. Ask for more input. How much input? Well, forget quarterly reviews.
Think daily reviews. Studies have found that in professions with less direct
feedback loops—stock analysis, psychiatry, and medicine—even the best get
worse over time."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breaking large tasks in programming into smaller chunks tends to naturally
  tighten the feedback loops involved. For example, if you set out to write some
  code that parses file type A, B, and C and then <em>wait</em> until implementing the
  parsing for all file types before running/testing it, your feedback is very
  flow. You write a lot of code first, then test later. This delayed feedback
  makes it difficult to track down the parts of the code that need to change
  based on that feedback. If there are bugs, you need to go back and check much
  more code to find the cause. Instead, if you set a goal of <em>only</em> parsing file
  type A, then check and verify that it works, you (a) get feedback much more
  quickly, and (b) reduce the amount of code you have to review to find problems
  when that feedback indicates problems.</p>
<p>But aside from problem decomposition, there are two other ways I've found to
  tighten feedback loops in programming: automated testing and making good use
  of REPLs. Automated tests, such as unit tests, provide extremely fast
  feedback. In many cases, you can run them after every change you make.
  Depending on what those tests cover, they can give you an immediate signal
  when you break something. If you continually run them as you work, then you
  have very few changes to review that are culprits. Automated tests are great
  ways to get fast feedback, especially while working in all but the smallest
  codebases, adding features, refactoring, etc. But writing automated tests
  isn't possible until you have a good idea of what it is your chunk of code
  under test <em>should</em> do. And writing tests also required you to make decisions
  about design (What parameters should I pass in here? How should the output be
  structured?). REPLs provide another way to get feedback that (a) can happen in
  much faster cycles, and (b) can be used while in an "exploratory" coding mode.
  Imagine you want to write a function that retrieves data from some external
  API, picks out some important bits of data, and returns it. Let's say you
  don't yet know what that incoming data will look like, and you're not sure
  what things you need to retrieve that data (API keys, query parameters, etc.).
  With a REPL, you can write one line of code (or a few) and execute it,
  instantly seeing the result. You can even combine this with "source code in a
  file" programming too, which I've found especially helpful for getting quicker
  feedback. I've used IPython and it's <code>autoreload</code> module to quickly write
  chunks of code and test them out. I can edit a function's code (in my text
  editor) and with a couple of keystrokes execute the function in a REPL. If I
  want to try the function with different inputs, I just type out the function
  call in the REPL. I get lots of feedback with very few decisions required.
  Even writing a simple unit test requires a lot of decisions: What do I name
  the test? How many cases should I test? Which cases are most important? How
  will my other code interact with this function? Is the code I'm working on
  even easy to get under test using my testing tools, or do I need to set up the
  scaffolding to do that? If I change my mind about what inputs the function
  should accept, I have to go change all the tests I wrote. Long story short, if
  you're finding it hard to focus on the task at hand, or you have uncertainty
  about how to write a particular passage of code, I recommend trying this
  approach. Build up a single function, one line at a time, running it in the
  REPL as you go, seeing the results of each small change you make. It's very
  engaging.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>More video games. As discussed in the book, playing video games is prone to
   creating lots of flow. Personally, I can't just jump into a game and be "in
   the zone" instantly. Recently, I've found I need to spend a significant
   period of time playing before it happens (i.e. upwards of 30 minutes).
   Perhaps it depends on the type of game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More consistent exercise. Intense phsyical exercise can trigger the flow
   state. Recently, I've developed a more consistent exercise routine than I've
   had the past few years. I'm much happier for it.</p>
