&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stevenkotler.com/book-pages/the-rise-of-super-man"&gt;The Rise of Superman: Decoding the Science of Ultimate Human Performance&lt;/a&gt;
by Steven Kotler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explores flow (the mental state associated with high performance and
distorted sense of time, among other things). It does so primarily by
chronicling the training and great feats of several action and adventure
(extreme) sports athletes. It also provides a brief background on flow research.
In the introductory pages, the author claims that although the book is about the
athletes, the larger goal of the narrative is to uncover how flow works so we
can harness it in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief history of flow research is provided, as well as an overview of our
current understanding of "flow triggers" and the brain activity (chemical and
electrical) that shows up in the state of flow. Again, it's not an incredibly
deep survey of the research, but is a good introduction for those unfamiliar
(like I was). From my memory, here are a few of the concepts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Characteristics of the flow state&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flow is autotelic, pleasurable and rewarding in and of itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of sense of time. Sometimes a slowing of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In extreme cases, loss of sense of self (i.e. the boundaries between self
    and "everything else").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each action flows naturally from one to the next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus is purely on here and now; the rest of the world slides away from conscious perception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measures of mental and physical performance skyrocket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creative solutions seem to appear out of nowhere into consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transient hypofrontality - A decrease in activity of the brain's
    prefrontal cortex. Presumed to be why one's "inner critic" is switched
    off (or at least reduced) in the state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External triggers of flow:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rich environment - lots of stimulus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast feedback - Your environment gives you fast/immediate feedback to your
    every action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk and danger - Physical risk sharpens focus. But creative and social
    risks can have similar effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal triggers of flow:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenge/skills balance - If the task at hand is too difficult, one
    experiences stress and doesn't enter flow. Too easy, and the brain isn't
    engaged with the activity; boredom is the result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accumulative impact of repeated flow "sessions". Repeatedly entering the flow
    state, repeatedly pushing one's boundaries that little bit further is what
    brought the athletes to their most groundbreaking accomplishments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the book is about action and adventure athletes (think big wave
surfers, skiiers, kayakers, mountaineers, climbers, etc.).  Kotler, turns out,
was an action and aventure sports journalist for a time and it shows. Lots of
extreme feats are recounted. It seemed every such tale was about "the most
daring, impossible, ridiculous &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; ever seen in the history of the sport of
&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;". Perhaps such diction is an accurate portrayal of these
accomplishements, but I must trust the author on this as I know very little
about extreme sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative often follows the evolution of individual athletes and sports,
showing how one "impossible" stunt led to the next. However, in my view, this
"pushing the impossible of given sport &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;" thread doesn't speak to the power of
flow as well as other aspects of these stories. Kotler says that flow is the
reason for the speed with which action sports have advanced. Fast compared to
what? It just doesn't seem a useful statement to me, but it does &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; good
(as in headline-worthy). That aside, there are aspects of these stories that are
fascinating. One of the big-wave surfers saved himself in a giant wave (~60ft
tall if I remember correctly) by pulling a move that he never practiced and had
never been used before by other surfers. See "creative solutions appearing out
of nowhere" above. The Red Bull Air Force learned how to interpret and predict a
teammate's intentions based solely on subtle movements of their feet. Not
something you'd think ordinarily possible (see "skyrocketing mental performance"
above). This helped them coordinate the group wingsuit BASE jump off the
top of Sears Tower in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I'm saying is: yes, these events are spectacular; yes, they redefined
what most people thought possible in the sport; but restating that over and
over again didn't help me understand flow any better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the last aspect of the book: applying what we know about flow
to cultivate more of it in our lives. Of the three main "threads" of this book
((1) flow research, (2) extreme athletes, and (3) practical advice), this had the fewest
words spent on it. Knowing the characteristics of flow can help us understand
&lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it has the effects it does. Seeing how extreme atheletes train can also
give us ideas, but it's usually not clear how to apply them to more "normal"
endeavors. Knowing the flow triggers (environmental and internal factors known
to cause the state) can inform how we structure our lives and training
to invite the state; this is the most directly applicable knowledge
presented in the book. There's just not much discussion of it compared to the
other content. The passages that do focus on it mostly feel like brief asides; I
would have appreciated more elaboration. That being said, there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; some useful
and thought-provoking bits. Here are a couple examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One professor interviewed for the book drives a different route to and from
    work everyday. This is (supposedly) a way to increase the novelty in his
    environment (which is a trigger of flow).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though most of our daily lives don't offer ample opportunity to risk life and
    limb, taking social and emotional risks can be a powerful flow trigger.
    Examples:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk humiliation by performing an instrument to an audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a presentation at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing/improving a skill slightly outside your area of expertise
    (lateralizing) in order to mitigate challenges that are too stressful
    otherwise. This is about (a) tuning the challenge/skills balance, and (b)
    maintaining momentum and forward progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The absence of self-knowledge makes it harder to tune the challenge/skill
    ratio." (Location 2307 in Kindle edition)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-awareness is key for tuning the challenge/skills ratio. As an aside,
    this is easier with physical exercise. It's pretty obvious when you're at
    the limits of your current strength/stamina/speed because you can't bring the
    weight off the floor anymore or you can't move your legs any faster. These
    limits are less obvious for purely intellectual activities. Finding good
    ways to gauge them is difficult, but doable. For example, if you read an
    article on astrophysics (for example) and find you aren't understanding
    most of it, then it's clearly beyond your current "skills" and some
    background reading on fundamental concepts would be prudent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break tasks into challenging, but manageable chunks. Trying to tackle
    something too large induces stress, which kicks you out of flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the section below for how I've applied some of these ideas to my own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll mention one last topic treated toward the end of the book: group
flow. The main point was that flow can occur simulataneously in a group of
people, with potentially &lt;em&gt;greater&lt;/em&gt; effects than individuals experiencing flow
alone. Here are some loosely related ideas that I found interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flow often happens in work conversations for a few reasons:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared background and knowledge, which eases communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ways to encourage group flow:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A shared "language" or background that the whole group can understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blending egos. People shouldn't be hogging the spotlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Always say yes." - Think "yes, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;" instead of "yes, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen fully. You shouldn't be consciously thinking about what to say next
  while listening to someone else speak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foster autonomy and competence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Style&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative tends to jump around quite often (from sport to sport and athlete
to athlete), requiring context switches that were jarring at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from this, the writing is approachable. Reads more like a long news
article than an essay. Lots of hypophoras. I just didn't love the writing style
for some reason, though. It wasn't &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;. Just wasn't particularly attractive to
me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things from this book I applied to my own life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not throwing yourself off skyscrapers for "sport", it's harder to get
into flow. But this book gave me a few ideas I was able to apply to my life and
work to positive effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decomposing work tasks into small chunks and setting time-based goals (e.g.
   complete XYZ in the next 1 hour). This was largely inspired by this excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Applying this idea in our daily life means breaking tasks into bite-size
chunks and setting goals accordingly. A writer, for example, is better off
trying to pen three great paragraphs at a timeâ€”the equivalent of moving
through Mandy-Raeâ€™s kick cyclesâ€”rather than attempting one great chapter.
Think challenging, yet manageable â€”just enough stimulation to shortcut
attention into the now, not enough stress to pull you back out again."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Location 2235 in Kindle edition)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this strategy to break down my programming tasks at work and found it
 particularly effective. Trying to tackle too large of a task/feature all at
 once makes my brain hurt, and I can spend lots of time thinking about it
 without getting much done. If I instead ask "What's the smallest step I can
 make right now toward this larger goal?" and focus on that smaller task (with
 a clearly defined expected result), then it's much easier to make progress
 and stay engaged. By putting more focus on this task decomposition
 process, I saw more consistent productivity in my day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tightening feedback loops:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tighten feedback loops. Put mechanisms in place so attention doesnâ€™t have to
wander. Ask for more input. How much input? Well, forget quarterly reviews.
Think daily reviews. Studies have found that in professions with less direct
feedback loopsâ€”stock analysis, psychiatry, and medicineâ€”even the best get
worse over time." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Location 2248 in Kindle edition)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking large tasks in programming into smaller chunks naturally
tightens the feedback loops involved. For example, if you set out to write some
code that parses file type A, B, and C and then &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; until implementing the
parsing for all file types before running/testing it, your feedback is very
slow. You write a lot of code first, then test later. This delayed feedback
makes it difficult to track down the parts of the code that need to change
based on that feedback; if there are bugs, you need to go back and check much
more code to find the cause. Instead, if you set a goal of &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; parsing file
type A, then check and verify that it works, you (a) get feedback much more
quickly, and (b) reduce the amount of code you have to review to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But aside from problem decomposition, there are two other ways I've found to
tighten feedback loops in programming: automated testing and making good use
of REPLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated tests, such as unit tests, provide extremely fast
feedback. In many cases, you can run them after every change you make.
Depending on what those tests cover, they can give you an immediate signal
when you break something. If you continually run them as you work, then you
have very few changes to review when a test starts failing. Automated
testing is a great way to get fast feedback, especially while working in
all but the smallest codebases, adding features, refactoring, etc. The
downside is that writing automated tests isn't possible until you have a
good idea of what your chunk of code under test &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do. And
writing tests also requires you to make decisions about design: What
parameters should I pass in here? How should the output be structured?.
Sometimes you may not &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; all the parameters required, or the best way to
structure the output until you do some experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REPLs provide another way to get feedback that (a) can happen in
much faster cycles, and (b) can be used while in an "exploratory" coding mode.
Imagine you want to write a function that retrieves data from some external
API, picks out some important bits of data, and returns it. Let's say you
don't yet know what that incoming data will look like, and you're not sure
what things you need in order to retrieve that data (API keys, query
parameters, etc.).  With a REPL, you can write one line of code (or a few)
and execute it, instantly seeing the result. You can even combine this with
"source code in a file" programming too, which I've found especially helpful
for getting quicker feedback. I've used IPython and it's &lt;code&gt;autoreload&lt;/code&gt; module
to quickly write chunks of code and test them out. I can edit a function's
code (in my text editor) and with a couple of keystrokes execute the
function in a REPL. If I want to try the function with different inputs, I
just type out the function call in the REPL. I get lots of feedback with
very few decisions required.  Even writing a simple unit test requires a lot
of decisions: What do I name the test? How many cases should I test? Which
cases are most important? How will my other code interact with this
function? Is the code I'm working on even easy to get under test using my
testing tools, or do I need to set up the scaffolding to do that? If I
change my mind about what inputs the function should accept, I have to go
change all the tests I wrote. Long story short, if you're finding it hard to
focus on the task at hand, or you have uncertainty about how to write a
particular passage of code, I recommend trying this approach. Build up a
single function, one line at a time, running it in the REPL as you go,
seeing the results of each small change you make. It's very engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More video games. As discussed in the book, playing video games is prone to
   creating lots of flow. Personally, I can't just jump into a game and be "in
   the zone" instantly. Recently, I've found I need to spend a significant
   period of time playing before it happens (i.e. upwards of 30 minutes). But
   interestingly, once I'm into the game, I'm pretty solidly "in the zone". Even
   if I need to take a quick break (get water, bio-break, etc.), it's usually
   easy to jump back into the flow of the game after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More consistent exercise. Intense physical exercise can trigger the flow
   state. Recently, I've developed a more consistent exercise routine than I've
   had in the past few years. I don't know how much flow I'm creating directly
   as a result of this, but I'm certainly much happier for it and believe it
   helps me perform better throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like writing and tend to have an opinion on writing style. So I'll probably
say a few words regarding style in my book reviews.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
