<p class="admonition-title">TL;DR</p>
<p>If you're running Docker for Mac and experiencing massive CPU spikes 
and slow response to Docker commands, ensure you've allocated enough 
memory and swap space to Docker. You can use the command below to 
inspect the Linux virtual machine that Docker is running in.<sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p><code>docker run -it --rm --pid host alpine /bin/sh</code></p>
<p>Then run <code>top</code> for CPU/mem usage and <code>iostat -m</code> for IO stats.</p>
<p>In my case, the CPU spikes were caused by memory starvation; the 
<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/259739/kswapd0-is-taking-a-lot-of-cpu/530661#530661">kswapd0</a> 
process was running hot, indicating likely 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)">thrashing</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>I've been working on packaging software for several different Linux
distributions. Docker containers provide a great environment to build and test
such packages. A little work is required to set up the containers to properly
imitate each operating system (e.g. installing and running the appropriate init
system), but once done you're left with a lightweight environment that can be
used to run tests across many different Linux distributions. Managing it with
Docker Compose gives further flexibility and ease of use. Until, of course, your
tests begin failing intermittently and Docker itself comes to a
screeching halt, grinding away for many seconds at simple <code>docker-compose ps</code>
commands.</p>
<p>Such was my dilemma.</p>
<p>To be more exact, my Docker Compose environment worked fine for about a minute
after starting. I could run the tests on the package (against all containers)
successfully one or two times. But then things would go south. The tests started
failing. The Docker daemon took <em>ages</em> to respond to simple commands. Meanwhile,
my laptop fans kicked into high gear and I noticed something peculiar:</p>
<figure>
    <a class="img-link" href="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/activity_monitor.png">
        <img src="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/activity_monitor.png" alt="Activity Monitor 
        shows 669% CPU utilization for com.docker.hyperkit">
    </a>
    <figcaption>Activity Monitor shows 669% CPU utilization for com.docker.hyperkit</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This behavior was consistent. I tore down the containers and started them up.
Same problem. I restarted the Docker daemon. Same problem: things worked briefly
and then broke.</p>
<p>I jumped on Google and started searching with the only searchable symptom I
had: massive CPU usage. Almost immediately, I found <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3499">com.docker.hyperkit 100%
cpu usage is back again</a>, an
extremely popular GitHub issue on the Docker for Mac repository. The bug is
<em>still</em> not fully understood, but the symptoms and mitigations proposed seemed
relevant to my own problem. In short, the issue describes how, while running no
containers at all, Docker CPU usage spikes (multiple times per day) and Docker
commands lock up. I only noticed my problem <em>while running containers</em>, but
that's a detail I (mistakenly) didn't give enough consideration to.</p>
<p>The current hypothesis for the bug's cause involves filesystem
synchronization between macOS and the Docker VM <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things that can cause the infinite loop seem to involve syncing of file system
events between OS-X and the docker VM. The fewer file system shares you have,
the less likely this is to occur. Similarly, if you can switch your filesystem
mounts to :cached then that means there will be fewer notifications being sent
back and forth between the Docker VM and OS-X, just less chance of the issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3499#issue-405295845">source (github.com)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I knew my Compose environment was utilizing bind mounts with potentially
high read/write frequency <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">3</a></sup>, so it seemed plausible that this bug report and 
<em>my</em> issue sprouted from the same core problem. Even if they didn't, the 
mitigations
proposed in the bug report gave me some easy ideas to try.</p>
<p>As suggested in the GitHub Issue, I removed a couple unnecessary file sharing
mounts from my Docker settings. No change.</p>
<p>The GitHub Issue mentioned using a
<code>:cached</code> setting on bind mounts, which I was unfamiliar with. So I read
through
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#performance-issues-solutions-and-roadmap">this</a>
and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/">this</a> to learn that
bind mounts on Docker for Mac had some pretty severe performance problems circa
2016, and that the <code>cached</code> and <code>delegated</code> options were developed in response
to that. They essentially provide a slightly-less-than-perfectly-consistent
synchronization between the container filesystem and the macOS filesystem.
Depending on your circumstance, one is a better choice than the other. But in my
case, I didn't actually need a bind mount at all. So I changed the suspect
bind-mount to a non-mounted Docker volume (i.e. a Docker volume <em>not</em> visible on
the macOS filesystem).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my problem remained.</p>
<p>I came across <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58277794/diagnosing-high-cpu-usage-on-docker-for-mac">Diagnosing high CPU usage on Docker for
Mac</a>
on StackOverflow, which seemed like exactly what I needed. The author asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I diagnose the cause of Docker on MacOS, specifically com.docker.hyperkit using 100% of CPU?</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/58277794">source (stackoverflow.com)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a couple answers, one of which involves using <code>dtrace</code> to look at
(macOS) kernel stack traces. Yikes! I'll save that for later, if I get
desperate. Thankfully, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58293240">this answer</a>
offered a quick way to look at the performance stats of the Docker VM
itself.</p>
<p>Normally when you run a container, you want that container to be as isolated as
possible from other containers/processes on the system. By default, a Docker
container is given its own PID namespace, which means it can't see other
processes on the system, and PIDs can be "reused" (i.e. your container can have
a PID 1 despite the fact there is already a PID 1 on the underlying system). Turns
out it's pretty easy to break out of this isolation if you want to. By
specifying the <code>host</code> option, the container is given access to the host's PID
namespace:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>docker run -it --rm --pid host &lt;image name&gt; &lt;command&gt;
</code></pre></div>


<p>See <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#pid-settings---pid">the Docker
docs</a> on the
<code>--pid</code> flag.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that in this case, "host" refers to the Docker VM, not the macOS host.
Remember, with Docker for Mac we're running containers <em>inside</em> a Linux VM,
which is in turn running on macOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Equipped with this new debugging ability, I can now look at what's happening in
the Linux VM. I start a shell with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>docker run -it --rm --pid host alpine /bin/sh
</code></pre></div>


<p>and start looking around. I look at IO stats:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/iostats_1.png"><img alt="IO stats in Docker VM shows 890MB_read/s on a couple devices" src="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/iostats_1.png"></a></p>
<p>Wow! 890MB of reads per second?! Seems kinda crazy. But I don't know if it's 
unusual, as I don't know what "normal" looks like.</p>
<p>I look at <code>top</code> output:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/top_1.png"><img alt="top output of Docker VM while running problematic containers" src="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/top_1.png"></a></p>
<p>I don't see anything too alarming, although the 92% user CPU usage is pretty dang
high. But I already knew that was happening. I don't see any obvious rogue
processes.</p>
<p>This was good visibility, but I needed a baseline comparison before I could
decide whether any of this was out of line. So I stopped all my
"problem" containers, started up a single MongoDB container, and looked at the
same system stats.</p>
<p>First, the IO stats:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/iostats_2.png"><img alt="IO stats in Docker VM shows roughly equivalent disk usage while running a
single container" src="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/iostats_2.png"></a></p>
<p>862MB of reads per second on two devices. Roughly the same as it was before. So
I guess <em>that's</em> not as unusual as I thought <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The <code>top</code> output, however, was quite different:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/top_2.png"><img alt="top output while running single container is quite different" src="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/top_2.png"></a></p>
<p><code>usr</code> CPU % is at 0, as are all processes on the system.</p>
<p>After seeing what these stats look like under working, normal conditions, I
decide to look more closely at the top output from before. The process taking up
the most CPU time is <code>[kswapd0]</code>. It was holding at a steady 16% CPU
utilization <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure what this process does. It took ~30 seconds to find what I needed 
to know:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process kswapd0 is the process that manages virtual memory.</p>
<p><a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/530661">source (askubuntu.com)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe the VM just needs more memory?</p>
<p>I look again at the <code>top</code> output recorded in my notes, and realize something
glaring I had overlooked before. Because <code>top</code> by default prints memory stats in
kilobytes, and my mushy brain doesn't really process numbers with that many
digits, I hadn't payed much attention to the memory usage stats <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Some quick calculations showed that out of 2GB available memory in the Docker
VM, only 2% was free! Further, the <code>VSZ</code> column showed that several processes
were using a large amount of memory <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I check my Docker settings, and find that I only have 2GB of memory (RAM)
allocated to Docker and only 1GB of swap:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/docker_resources.png"><img alt="My Docker resources
settings" src="https://dsabsay.github.io/blog/images/docker_resources.png"></a></p>
<p>I change the swap to 4GB, start up all my containers, and everything runs
beautifully! <code>usr</code> CPU usage in the Docker VM is at 4%, <code>kswpad0</code> CPU usage is at
0%, and <code>com.docker.hyperkit</code> is hovering at around 115% CPU usage. This latter
stat may seem strange, but is likely just an artifact of how CPU usage is
calculated in the Docker VM and is probably related to the fact
my machine has multiple CPU cores. In any event, my Compose environment is
stable and working as expected!</p>
<p>So what does this mean? </p>
<p>To my best reckoning, the VM was spending tons of CPU
cycles shuffling bits in and out of swap because there wasn't enough resident
memory allocated to the VM to run all those heavy processes. On top of that,
there wasn't much swap space to work with, so the system was essentially memory
starved.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned<a class="headerlink" href="#lessons-learned" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>After every serious debugging session, I like to reflect on the experience and
identify helpful and harmful behaviors. If I do this enough, hopefully I'll get
better at debugging. Here are a few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Any process that has constant and fairly high CPU usage is suspicious.</strong> There
    <em>could</em> be situations where you would expect to see this, but in my case
    there was no good reason to see this. The <code>kswapd0</code> process was a red flag I
    missed the first time I saw it.</li>
<li><strong>When looking at bug reports and their associated root causes, prioritize
    <em>eliminating</em> it as a
    possible cause as quickly as possible.</strong> Led by my initial search results
    concerning bind-mount performance, I spent a good deal of time reading about 
    different bind-mount options and development history. Eventually, I removed 
    bind-mounts from the equation entirely, and
    concluded it was <em>not</em> the problem, and could move on to other
    possibilities. I wish I had done this sooner; I wish I hadn't spent so much time
    dwelling on this possible cause. It was not all for naught, though. I did
    learn some things about Docker (for Mac) by pursuing that thread.</li>
<li><strong>Work from facts and be wary of assumptions that you can't support with some
    analysis.</strong> This is a more general statement of the previous lesson. I ran
    for longer than I should have with the idea that a bind-mount problem was
    the culprit (as discussed directly above). Validating (or invalidating)
    assumptions is necessary for forward progress. Sticking with unproven
    assumptions for too long is harmful.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure your debugging tools present information in a way that is <em>easy</em> for
    you to read and interpret.</strong> Evidently, when I
    do not heed this advice, I ignore important data.
    I skipped over the <em>glaringly obvious</em> memory usage problem
    presented by <code>top</code> the first time I looked at it. Why? Because the data was
    presented in kilobytes, I couldn't make sense of it easily, and moved on. But
    it was exactly the data I needed to see.</li>
<li><strong>When looking at stats and metrics, having a real baseline (not a
    hypothetical one) to compare to is
    crucial.</strong> Aside from memory usage (which was an obvious red flag I
    missed), I wasn't sure whether the other statistics were unusual or
    not. Getting the baseline reading made the problem much easier to see. I
    imagine the more experience you have with a particular system, the less
    this may be necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="addendum">Addendum: Don't guess what metrics mean<a class="headerlink" href="#addendum" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>I related a couple times how I concluded the output from <code>iostat</code> (IO
statistics) was "not unusual". I now question that conclusion.</p>
<p>As I used it in
this debugging adventure, <code>iostat</code> was reporting based on the entire history of
the VM since boot. So the <code>890MB_read/s</code> is an average across quite a lot of
time. I did not restart Docker before getting my baseline reading of this
metric (with the single MongoDB container), and thus might have deceived myself.
In other words, the <code>890MB_read/s</code> may actually <em>be</em> high compared to
normal Docker usage. However, since my "baseline" reading was essentially an average which <em>included</em>
the time the "problem" containers were running in the Docker VM, it probably was
<em>not</em> a proper baseline. A proper baseline would have been an average reading
from a fresh reboot of the VM, followed by running the single MongoDB container.
The fact that the <em>supposed</em> baseline reading was a bit lower than the first
reading (<code>860MB_read/s</code> vs. <code>890MB_read/s</code>) supports this. I don't care to recreate
everything as before to verify; I'm reasonably confident that I am correct
<em>now</em>; I most likely fooled myself with the <code>iostat</code> comparison.</p>
<p>My inner dialogue at that point in the investigation was something
like <em>"Hmmm that seems like a big number. I wonder if that's normal."</em> I wanted to
quickly get a baseline to compare to. I was too hasty.</p>
<p>This seems appropriate as another "lesson learned":</p>
<p><strong>If you are reasoning based on metrics, make sure you understand
how those metrics are calculated.</strong> By not taking the time to think about how
the MB_read/s was calculated, I created a useless comparison.</p>
